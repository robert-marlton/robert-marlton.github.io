I worked with a Mr Daz Westall,
And up to the top he did crawl,
He's now leaving the bean, to go bust his spleen,
Running a business that's small.

I worked with a guy known as Daz,
And this guy he had a lot of pizzaz,
He's not known for sports, but he is for ripped shorts,
And soon, the great business he has.   

To Darren, who once was my boss,
You leaving will be a great loss,
You've left us all alone, now that you've flown,
But I bet that you don't give a toss.

We are losing our CTO,
As he has said that he now must go,
He's off by himself, but he's not on the shelf
Provided his business does grow. 

Darren's great plans are unfurled,
He's running a start up with perl,
From Broadbean he fled, to work from his shed, 
And see more of his small little girl.

Broadbean has suffered a blow,
As we are losing our CTO,
I need to get off my chest, that he is the best
I wish that he wouldn't go

Broadbean has suffered a blow,
As we are losing our CTO,
I need to get off my chest, that he is the best
I wish that he wouldn't go

Darren's leaving is a bit of a curse,
There is not a lot that is worse,
Goodbye my friend, but at last I can end
This week of extremely bad verse.
